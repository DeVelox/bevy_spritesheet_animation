/// A Bevy component that enables spritesheet animations.

/// It contains an [AnimationId] that references an [Animation](crate::prelude::Animation) created with [SpritesheetLibrary::new_animation](crate::prelude::SpritesheetLibrary::new_animation).

/// The animation can be paused and resumed by toggling the `playing` field.
///
/// The speed of the animation can be tweaked with `speed_factor`.

/// # Note

/// For this component to take effect, the entity must also have a Bevy [TextureAtlas](bevy::prelude::TextureAtlas) component.

/// # Example
///
/// ```
